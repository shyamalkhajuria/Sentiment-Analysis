We just happened to call literally 15 minutes before our deadline on cancellation to ask for extra beds and followed up by asking if the hotel was sold out & the receptionist answered by saying there was a wedding on all 3 days of our stay & 48 hours before claimed that she didn‚Äôt know which venues would be occupied & that it was a 50 person wedding which in reality was a 400 person wedding!! Terrible experience as there were multiple events happening throughout the hotel & we literally spent our stay in the lounge watching cricket & our kids watching their iPad. We were sent pictures of the children‚Äôs pool and that was honestly our biggest attraction, but when we checked-in, they said we couldn‚Äôt use it because of the wedding!"

"Le Meredien, NCR",Apr-21,,"We visited India (Delhi and Bangalore) in April 2021. We stayed 2 weeks at Le Meridian, Delhi NCR for the Delhi segment. Although these were the worst of times in India due to the spiraling pandemic, we felt very safe and well looked after during the entire stay. The hotel staff diligently followed all the Covid safety guidelines and ensured safe distancing and mask wearing for all staff and public as appropriate. The restaurants were consolidated if needed due to small number of guests but the quality of food and service never suffered. Similarly the housekeeping, laundry and the front desk staff worked extra hard to ensure a stress free stay for us. Our regular housecleaning person (Dev), restaurant waiters (Nishakar and others), Chefs at the restaurants and front desk and sales staff (Mayank Singh, Rahul and others) deserve a special mention for making our stay comfortable. We will plan to stay here again on our next visit. Keep up the good work.‚Äù"

Taj Bengal Kolkata,Jan-21,,"New Years at Taj Bengal was a wonderful experience, all thanks to the exemplary service and the courteous staff. A group of 16, of our friends, along with their respective family decided to stay at Taj Bengal on 31st Dec ‚Äô20 and 1st Jan ‚Äô21 to give a fresh start to the new year, and the decision was not regretted at all.The first thing which we noticed was the sanitization of the hotel, and the protective measure the staff took as a shield against COVID-19. Regular sanitizing, maintaining proper distance, use of protective equipment was spot on. On arrival at the hotel, we were welcomed and greeted by Smriti Mohandas, who very smoothly facilitated the check-in process and made sure we faced no issues, and considered all our requests. Upon request, we were provided free room upgrade as a gesture of goodwill.The rooms provided were form of true art and too spacious. I would like to mention the hospitality of Saurabh Mitra, the Front Office Manager, who attended us, and honoured us by arranging a meeting with the General Manager, Mr. Vijay Shrekent.Mr. Vijay's friendly and courteous nature was a sign of his cheerful and generous personality.The food served during our entire stay was, least to say, scrumptious, and was served hot and delicious each and every time, thanks to restaurant staff, Mr. Manoj, the restaurant manager, Ms. Ipsita, who hosted us, and Cruz Basu and Avik, because of whom we enjoyed our stay at the hotel.We availed the services of spa and gymnasium as well, and had a relaxing time there. With our stay coming to the end, last but not the least, Mr. Abhijeet Sarmah, too deserves a mention for ensuring smooth checkout. It was a lovely start to our year, and the hospitality shown by Taj deserves an applause. This for sure is one of the most amazing stay we had.‚Äù"
Taj Bengal Kolkata,Nov-20,,"‚ÄúWe were concerned about how safe the hotel would be from the pandemic point of view. I'd give it full marks. Next, the room was in perfect order, with all the right amenities sanitized and disinfected. My wife and I felt emboldened to avail of the spa services and it was a good decision.

You could find the staff following covid protocall . The floor lift area was also having sanatizer stand The room size is huge and ask for valley view room . Overall a good stay in pandemic
The Lalit Chandigarh,Jan-21,Manik Singhal,"I stayed for 7 days. I had concerns with the staff.Given covid times, hotel claimed good sanitization and hygeine. But staff in meals area didn't have standard proper masks. All had different type of masks and some wore them sincerely while others didn't care much. I haven't seen such category hotels to ignore such practices. On the day of their audit, all staff was extra cautious and everything was being properly executed. Each table was also provided a sanitizer bottle. It felt like a local office where people do proper and right work only to show superiors and it is not what they follow regularly. My feedback is based on relative comparison among hotels of this category. And I expect a good degree of hospitality and discipline from such hotels, else what is the use of being top class"

"Taj Hotel, Chandigarh",Jun-21,Gaurav G,The covid-19 protocols are not followed at any level. Worst service being given in rooms. The major part of property being air conditioner not working for the full night. Worst experience for my lifetime. Sometimes hair comes in the food and sometimes hands without gloves and all our id and everything being used and returned unsanitized. Not following most of the govt. Guidelines. Taj known as the strongest brand of india in hotels provide the worst service which a normal 2 star hotel provides. We cannot differentiate much from the services given specially when the couple is out for a special occassion. They know well how to spoil the day for the same. Not once but they did twice in a year. Its wrong if we give them a chance too.

They go out of their way to help you and make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Big shout out to Ms. Aditi for going out of her way to make our stay great.
"Taj Usha Kiran Palace, Gwalior",Jan-21,Akhilesh Jha,"This was my second stay and I could clearly notice a fall in quality. Any heritage property is only as good as its upkeep and maintenance and this property needs a lot of it. Bathroom fittings leaked, only 20L of hot water could never fill the grand bath tub, touch-free dispensers should be a norm in Covid times. None of the above one expects from a Taj property."
"Taj Usha Kiran Palace, Gwalior",Nov-20,Dr Preet,The restaurant (only one) was good and the staff was helpful. We took the 4D (meals included) package and they had the same set menu. The staff was accomodating thankfully and the food was good. The place was not crowded so that allowed Social Distancing measures to be followed.
,,,The property is smaller than other Taj Palaces but still has a nice traditional touch to it. We felt the common areas could be slightly better maintained.
,Oct-20,Sunny,Had an ok experience not that great what was expecting with Taj Properties. Also doesn‚Äôt feel so safe due to Covid conditions mainly at the entrance. Rest staff and food is good. Rooms were very spacious but not at all maintained and giving an excuse for heritage property sorry can‚Äôt digest that. Room need refurbishment.

"Trident, Agra",Mar-21,Akil M,The best part was the restaurant staff who took great care of us and provided us everything we asked. The only area of improvement would be for the staff to enforce the mask rule more stringently. Too many other guest were roaming around in public spaces without mask
"Trident, Agra",Feb-21,Deepten C,"What was planned to be an exemplary stay turned out to be lackluster and quite a dampener. Surprisingly, inspite of the Covid related wariness, one found the hotel quite filled to capacity, and that's possibly due to the quite competitive tariffs the hotel was offering. However, this also meant that the service levels went down by several notches. The staff at the restaurant was completely unable to handle the crowd and one could see them running around cluelessly."
